# Project Title

Movie Recommendation System Using Python 

## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP), cosine similarity, and Python. The system recommends movies to users based on the similarity of movie plots.

## Features

Recommend movies based on plot similarity.
Utilizes cosine similarity to measure plot similarity.
Efficient NLP techniques to preprocess movie plots.



## Prereqisites

Python 3.8 or higher,

Pandas python library,

sklearn connected library



Install required dependencies:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
